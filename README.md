### Hi, I´m Guillermo Angulo 👋
I´m a web developer focused on Javascript (Node.js and ReactJS). I was born in Bilbao (Spain) and I´m currently living in São Paulo (Brazil). 

```javascript
const guillermo = {
  code: [Javascript, HTML, CSS],
  technologies: [Node, React],
  tools: [Next, Gatsby, Redux]
}
```

### I’m currently focused on 👨‍💻
Trying to improve my skills on both NodeJS and React. I have developed some **back-end** projects on Node (like a [movie-bot](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/movie-bot)). And also some **front-end** projects with React using NextJS or GatbsyJS (like a [clothes shop](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/react-graphql-shop)).<br/>
