### Hi, I´m Guillermo Angulo 👋
I´m a web developer focused on Javascript (Node.js and ReactJS). I was born in Bilbao (Spain) and I´m currently living in São Paulo (Brazil). 

```javascript
const guillermo = {
  code: [Javascript, HTML, CSS],
  technologies: [Node, React],
  tools: [Create React App, Next, Gatsby, Redux]
}
```

### I’m currently focused on 👨‍💻
I´m trying to improve my skills on both NodeJS and React. I have developed some back-end projects on Node (like a [movie-bot](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/movie-bot), or a [COVID-19 API](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/covid-19-api-brasil). And also some front-end projects with React using NextJS or GatbsyJS (like a [clothes shop](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/react-graphql-shop) or a [movie reviews app](https://github.com/GuilleAngulo/movie-reviews)).<br/>
